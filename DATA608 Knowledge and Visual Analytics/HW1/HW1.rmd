```{Setup and Problem1}
dat <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charleyferrari/CUNY_DATA608/master/lecture1/Data/inc5000_data.csv')
summary(dat)
head(dat)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#1. Create a graph that shows the distribution of companies in the dataset by State (ie how many are in each state). 

#count companies by state
companyState <- dat %>%
  select(Name, State) %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(Companies = n())
companyState

#reverse order of state names
companyState <- within(companyState, State <- ordered(State, levels = rev(State)))

#plot barchart
ggplot(companyState, aes(y = Companies, x = State)) + geom_bar(fill = 'orange3', stat='identity') + coord_flip()
```

```{Problem 2}
#2. Create a plot of average employment by industry for companies in this state 

#find state with third most companies
orderedStates <- companyState %>%
  arrange(desc(Companies))
thirdState <- orderedStates[3,][,1]
dat$State[dat$State == toString(thirdState)]
#filter by third state
avgEmploymentIndustry <- dat %>%
  filter(State == toString(thirdState[[1]])) 
avgEmploymentIndustry <- avgEmploymentIndustry[complete.cases(avgEmploymentIndustry),]

#reverse order of industry names
avgEmploymentIndustry <- within(avgEmploymentIndustry, Industry <- ordered(Industry, levels = rev(Industry)))

#define limits to exclude outliers
outlierLimits <- as.numeric(quantile(avgEmploymentIndustry$Employees, c(0.1, 0.9)))

#plot barchart
ggplot(avgEmploymentIndustry, aes(y = Employees, x = Industry)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA, fill = 'orange3') + scale_y_continuous(limits = outlierLimits) + coord_flip()

```

```{Problem 3}
#3 Now imagine you work for an investor and want to see which industries generate the most revenue per employee.

#calculate revenue per employee
revenueEmployee <- dat %>%
  select(Revenue, Employees, Industry) %>%
  mutate(revEmploy = Revenue / Employees)

#remove incomplete cases
revenueEmployee<- revenueEmployee[complete.cases(revenueEmployee),]

#define limits to exclude outliers
outlierLimits <- as.numeric(quantile(revenueEmployee$revEmploy, c(0.1, 0.9)))

#plot barchart
ggplot(revenueEmployee, aes(y = revEmploy, x = Industry)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA, fill = 'orange3') + scale_y_continuous(limits = outlierLimits) + coord_flip()

```
